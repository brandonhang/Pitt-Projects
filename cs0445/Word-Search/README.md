This project creates an auto word search that can search for individual words or entire phrases.  In 3A, phrases can change direction only when an entire word within the phrase has been found first.  Only the first occurrence of the phrase will be found as well.  In 3B, individual letters can change direction at any time.  Still, only the first occurrence of the phrase will be found.  In 3C, functionality is similar to 3A but all occurrences of the phrase will be searched for.  At no time will the program search in a diagonal direction.
