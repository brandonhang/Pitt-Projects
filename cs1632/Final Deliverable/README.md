This deliverable is a fully test-driven developed (TDD) version of baccarat, a popular casino card game.  It was developed
exclusively using TDD such that tests were written before any implementation code.  The game utilizes the punto banco
variant of rules and is a bit simplified in that it only uses a single deck rather than 4, 6, or 8 decks.  However, it
does enable betting on each hand and features ASCII art for each card or hand of cards drawn.  This project was originally
submitted on 04/19/2016.
