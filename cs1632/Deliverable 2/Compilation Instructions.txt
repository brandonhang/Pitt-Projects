------------ How to Compile the JUnit Tests ------------

JUnit tests REQUIRE the Eclipse IDE:
	1. Copy or clone the "coffee_hunter_pro" and
	   "coffee_maker_junit_tests" folders from GitHub.
	
	2. Create a new project in Eclipse and load the
	   folders into the project.
	
	3. JUnit test cases are located in the
	   "coffee_maker_junit_tests" folder/package.
	
	4. Run each JUnit test case individually or run the
	   entire test plan by right-clicking the package in
	   Eclipse and selecting "Run As" -> "JUnit Test".
