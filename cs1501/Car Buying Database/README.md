This program simulates a car-buying text-based app that sorts a database of cars by either lowest mileage
or lowest price.  It also can retrieve the lowest price or mileage car of a specific make or model or update
specific cars by using the entered VIN.  The VIN must be 17 characters long and cannot contain the letters
'I', 'O', or 'Q'.  The program is run as "java CarTracker" without any parameters.  This project was
originally submitted on 03/21/2016.
